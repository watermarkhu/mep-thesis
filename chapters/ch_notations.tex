\chapter{Notations}
In this chapter, we will present an object-oriented implementation of surface code simulations. The goal of this chapter is not to describe in detail the classes and methods used for these simulations, but mainly introduce the notion of object attributes. In the remainder of the thesis, we will often refer to variables that are stored \emph{at} some physical entity, with which we mean that the variable is stored as an attribute at the class instance of that entity. 


\begin{definition}
    An attribute $var$ stored at the object $x$ is denoted by the notation $x.var$.
