\chapter{Conclusions}


\begin{itemize}
  \item The Union-Find Balanced-Bloom decoder has an improved decoder threshold compared with the Union-Find decoder for all lattice sizes and a comparable threshold to the Minimum-Weight Perfect Matching decoder for small lattices.
  \item The Union-Find Balanced-Bloom decoder has an improved decoding rate at the threshold error rate compared with the Union-Find decoder for all lattice sizes. 
  \item A degradation of the error threshold of the Union-Find Balanced-Bloom decoder on larger lattice sizes is expected due to the effects of parity inversion and increased node delays. 
  \item The matching weight of the Union-Find Balanced-Bloom decoder is decreased from the matching weight of the Dynamic-forest Bucket Union-Find decoder by a factor of ?
  \item For a constant value of the equilibrium factor, $k_{eq}=\frac{1}{2}$ results in the best performance in the Union-Find Balanced-Bloom decoder.  
\end{itemize}
