\chapter{Conclusions}


\begin{itemize}
  \item The Union-Find Balanced-Bloom decoder has an improved decoder threshold compared with the Union-Find decoder for all lattice sizes and a comparable threshold to the Minimum-Weight Perfect Matching decoder for small lattices.
  \item The Union-Find Balanced-Bloom decoder has an improved decoding rate at the threshold error rate compared with the Union-Find decoder for all lattice sizes. 
  \item A degradation of the error threshold of the Union-Find Balanced-Bloom decoder on larger lattice sizes is expected due to the effects of parity inversion and increased node delays. 
  \item The matching weight of the Union-Find Balanced-Bloom decoder is decreased from the matching weight of the Dynamic-forest Bucket Union-Find decoder by a factor of ?
  \item For a constant value of the equilibrium factor, $k_{eq}=\frac{1}{2}$ results in the best performance in the Union-Find Balanced-Bloom decoder.  
\end{itemize}

Recent work that include the Union-Find decoder focuses on bringing the decoder algorithm to the hardware level. Most notably, a scalable decoder micro-architecture has been proposed with a fully pipelined hardware implementation \cite{das2020scalable}. Related work has shown that a reduction in bandwidth is possible provided qubits with a low physical error rate \cite{delfosse2020hierarchical}. 

Finally, another variant of the decoder dubbed the \emph{Weighted Union-Find} decoder, not to be confused with \emph{weighted growth}, promises to increase the code threshold under circuit level noise \cite{huang2020fault}. This application relies on adopting the decoder to a \emph{weighted} graph, where every edge $e\in\m{E}$ may have a different length value, and edges are not limited to growth of half-edges per growth iteration. We believe that Union-Find Balanced-Bloom decoder and the Weighted Union-Find decoder to be compatible, where in the combined decoder boundary edges in each node are grown with respect to their weights in the weighted graph.

Using the same range of lattice sizes and error rates, we simulate and plot also for our implementation of the Union-Find decoder, the Dynamic-forest Bucket Union-Find (DBUF) decoder and the Union-Find Balanced-Bloom decoder (UFBB), and the Minimum-Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) decoder.}
