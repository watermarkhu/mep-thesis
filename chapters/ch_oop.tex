\chapter{Object-oriented surface code simulations}
In this chapter, we will present an object-oriented implementation of surface code simulations. Built on top of this implementation, we will provide complementary description for the some missing instructions for the Union-Find decoder, as well as a modification that improves upon the original decoder in terms of the decoder threshold at the expense of a slightly increased complexity.
